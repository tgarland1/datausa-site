        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The <span class="emphasize">American Community Survey (ACS)</span> is conducted by the US Census and sent to a portion of the population every year. Data USA does not contain the entire ACS dataset but instead relavent topics to the curated profile pages of the site. As of the 2014 (most recent) ACS release there are 1 year and 5 year estimates. Previously there was also a 3 year estimate which has now been discontinued.</p>
        <h2>Where is it used?</h2>
        <p>The ACS dataset is used on the Geography, Occupation and Industry profiles. Although the ACS dataset includes some data on occupations and industries, Data USA is mostly using the ACS dataset for demographics on the Geography profiles.</p>
        <h2>Caveats</h2>
        <p>Due to sampling constraints, there is often a high margin of error when looking at data for smaller geographies. Apply caution when drawing conclusions from small geographic areas (for example: small counties, places and particularly tracts).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="dataset-tab" data-tab="2">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The <span class="emphasize">American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS)</span> files are a set of untabulated records about individual people or housing units. The Census Bureau produces the PUMS files so that data users can create custom tables that are not available through pretabulated (or summary) ACS data products.</p>
        <h2>Where is it used?</h2>
        <p>The ACS PUMS dataset is used throughout the site where specific data cross sections are not made available through the preformatted ACS dataset. ACS PUMS data is the cornerstone of the occupations and industry data used throughout the Geography, Occupation and Industry profiles. Data USA also uses ACS PUMS to compare a location's current stock of graduates versus students currently pursuing high education degrees (provided by the IPEDs dataset).</p>
        <h2>Caveats</h2>
        <p>The PUMS dataset is complex. While we have computed aggregations of the data, we run manual spot checks in an attempt to validate our aggregations and calculations. We do not have an independent, automated validation process to verify every calculation, therefore please use particular caution when using the PUMS data on this site.</p>
        <p>Similar to the ACS dataset there are sometimes sampling biases when looking at data from a specifc slice of data. Due to the way the data is aggregated, ACS PUMS data is only availabe for the Nation, States and Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs).</p>
        <p>Wage values are adjusted using the ADJINC variable from the PUMS file.</p>
        <p>There are four main universes of tables: "workforce", "full-time" and "part-time". The default and most prevalent universe for our PUMS data uses the workforce universe. The conditions for this universe:
        </p>
        <br>
          <ol>
            <li>Age of 16 years or older</li>
            <li>Wage greater than zero</li>
            <li>In the workforce (i.e. ESR code of 1,2,4,5)</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <p>In addition, the above criteria full-time universe rows must have WKHP &gt;= 35, whereas part-time universe rows have WKHP &lt; 35.</p>
          <br>
        <p>
        The other universe is everyone five years of age and older (that is the only restriction). This universe is only used for visualizations showing birthplaces for a location from PUMS.
        </p>
        <p>
        Another caveat to note is that when we display top statistics from PUMS data, such as highest average wage, or most common occupation, we will typically only show the top values where several (>=5) records are collapsed.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The <span class="emphasize">Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)</span> publishes data on Input-Output also called Make-Use for industries in the United States. This Dataset is provided by the US Department of Commerce.</p>
        <h2>Where is it used?</h2>
        <p>The BEA I/O tables are used on the industry pages showing the input and output industries for the specified industry profile page.</p>
        <h2>Caveats</h2>
        <p>The BEA I/O tables use a modified version of the North American Industry Classification (NAICS) meaning that certain industry pages do not have a corresponding BEA I/O table industry and are thus swapped for the closest match.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="dataset-tab" data-tab="4">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The <span class="emphasize">Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)</span> is a public dataset made available by the United States Department of Labor.</p>
        <h2>Where is it used?</h2>
        <p>The BLS dataset is used on the Occupation and Industry pages showing the publicly available expected growth numbers in both number of employees and salary.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="dataset-tab" data-tab="5">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The <span class="emphasize">University of Wisconsin County Health Rankings (CHR)</span> dataset is a collaboration between the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute.</p>
        <h2>Where is it used?</h2>
        <p>The CHR data is used on the Geography profiles in the health and safety section.</p>
        <h2>Caveats</h2>
        <p>With regard to granularity the CHR dataset only includes State and County level data. Population estimates for 2016 CHR data are based on 2014 Census population estimates, and 2015 CHR data are based on 2011 Census population estimates.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="dataset-tab" data-tab="6">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The <span class="emphasize">Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)</span> was developed in 1990 to monitor priority health risk behaviors that contribute markedly to the leading causes of death, disability, and social problems among youth and adults in the United States. These behaviors, often established during childhood and early adolescence, include:
			  - Behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence.<br>
			  - Sexual behaviors related to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV infection.<br>
			  - Alcohol and other drug use.<br>
			  - Tobacco use.<br>
			  - Unhealthy dietary behaviors.<br>
			  - Inadequate physical activity.<br>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The mortality data is from the <span class="emphasize">National Vital Statistics System (NVSS)</span> are a fundamental source of demographic, geographic, and cause-of-death information. This is one of the few sources of health-related data that are comparable for small geographic areas and are available for a long time period in the United States. The data are also used to present the characteristics of those dying in the United States, to determine life expectancy, and to compare mortality trends with other countries.
