      - "By now, every thinking person should be aware of the consequences of tobacco use, of all types and usages.   Cigarette smoking is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths per year in the United States -- about one in five deaths annually, or 1,300 deaths every day.1 Beyond deaths, smoking-related illness in the United States costs more than $300 billion each year:1,4 Further, tobacco use and addiction mostly begin during youth and young adulthood (5,2)."
      - "The best approaches for reducing teen smoking are advertising and raising the cost of tobacco products. All 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC) have tobacco control programs that are funded through various revenue streams, including tobacco industry settlements and excise taxes.  However, states are only spending a minor fraction of the tobacco-related revenues on tobacco control and cessation programs.  For example, in 2010, states spent an average of 2.6 percent of the roughly $24 billion in tobacco revenues (including tobacco settlement funds) on such programs."
      - "Added emphasis may be brought on state legislators to increase spending on cessation and control programs if teen smoking rates and tobacco-related mortality can be displayed. Principal among the directly-related effects of tobacco use is lung cancer mortality."
      - "Examining data from CDC mortality and CDC NPCR cancer morbidity files along with YRBS and BRFSS surveys, the public can examine how their states are doing to reduce teen smoking, how the state fares with regard to female mortality and morbidity, and examine these issues by race.  For example in all but 12 states (and DC), white female lung cancer mortality exceeds that of all other race and ethnicities.  Advocates will want to examine the root causes of white and other female lung cancer mortality in their states."

      - "--- Heart Disease ---" 
      - "Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both males and females in the nation.  The highest rates of female mortality occur in the South-Central portion of the nation.1 A few states have the highest overall rates, the greatest female-to-national female averages, and the largest female-to-male average mortality rates. Concerned citizens in these states may wish to explore the mortality rates for women in their state and how women in their states compare to others with regard to the causative factors leading to heart disease and ultimately to deaths.  These factors include:"
      - "Smoking, High cholesterol, High blood pressur, Physical inactivity, Obesity and overweight, Diabetes"
      - "The YRBS and BRFSS can shed light on these causative factors by sex, race, and age."
